This is the readme file for the cot-updater folder.

The goal of those files is to be put toghether on an USB device to be pluggued on the automate.
The automate will auto discover changes in /media and if possible execute /media/usb/cot-update.sh script.
So the script has to handle all the update process.
Once the script is successfuly executed, the automate will restart itself.
