This is the readme file for the cot-translator application.

The goal of this tool is to allow translations extraction from a json file into a given folder using the 'export' mode.
The generated ts files can then be opened using Qt Linguist to be translated by translators.
Once done, just import the translations into the json file using the 'import' mode.
